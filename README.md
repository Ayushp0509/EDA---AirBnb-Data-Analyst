Recommending marketing campaign strategies and predicting the destination neighborhoods in high demand. Focus on top-performing areas to maximize bookings and reduce marketing costs.

By identifying the top 20 neighborhoods with high booking numbers, we can target these areas for marketing campaigns, optimizing advertising efforts, and reducing marketing costs.

**Key Findings:**

- Guests prefer entire home/apartment or private rooms over shared rooms.
- Manhattan and Brooklyn are the most demanded neighborhood groups.
- Most bookings fall within the $10-400 price range, with private rooms and entire home/apartment types receiving the most reviews.
- Top hosts concentrate listings in Manhattan and Brooklyn, suggesting higher prices and more bookings.

## **Conclusion**

The EDA reveals valuable insights for both hosts and guests. Hosts can tailor their offerings based on popular amenities and competitive pricing. Guests can make informed decisions about location, amenities, and pricing. Although the dataset has limitations, conducting EDA enhances understanding of the short-term rental market dynamics, improving the user experience for both hosts and guests.
